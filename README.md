​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
We have a Blue background which consist of a Blue #0000ff color. This includes the columns as well as to make everything match.
We have a open rounded border circle which has the color #fff as to be completly white inside the blue box.

For the playing chip we have Red #ff0000 and Yellow #ffff00. These are meant to shift between the two color whenever you click once and twice.

Then there are similar colors on the names for each player corresponding correct color.

Its four in a row. You're able to play in a lan motion with someone else on the same computer, you can win in any direction aslong as you get 4 in a row. The features are that it automatically adds score points to the corresponding person depending if Red or Yellow wins.
